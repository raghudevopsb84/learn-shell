# if condition
# case condition
# if condition is the widely used one in shell. Its alternative case command have basic functionality, Hence it is not that much preferred.

# If condition can be made in three forms
# 1. Simple IF

#syntax:
#if [ expression ]; then
#  commands
#fi

# commands are going to execute only if expression is true

# 2. IF-Else

#syntax:
#if [ expression ]; then
#  commands-x
#else
#  commands-y
#fi

# commands-x will run if expression is true, else it will run commands-y

# 3. Else-IF

#syntax:
#if [ expression1 ]; then
#  commands
#elif [ expression2 ]; then
#  commands
#...... can go for expression-n
#else
#  commands
#fi

# which ever expression is true, its associated commands will be executed.

## In Expressions always use double quotes for variables. For numbers & strings it is not necessary.

# Expressions can be logical combined as well.
# -a - AND
# -o - OR

# exp1        exp2          AND         OR
# true        true          true      true
# true        false         false     true
# false       true          false     true
# false       false         false     false
